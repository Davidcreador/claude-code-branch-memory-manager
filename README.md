> **Never lose context when switching git branches with Claude Code**

Automatically manages branch-specific `CLAUDE.md` files so Claude always has the right context for your current work. Switch branches seamlessly without losing your development context, notes, or current progress.

## ‚ö° Quick Start

**One-line installation**:
```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Davidcreador/claude-code-branch-memory-manager/main/install.sh | bash
```

**Immediate usage**:
```bash
# Create your first memory
echo "# Working on main branch" > CLAUDE.md
branch-memory save "Initial project setup"

# Test automatic switching
git checkout -b feature/new-api
# üéâ Memory automatically switches!

git checkout main  
# üéâ Your original context is restored!
```

That's it! No configuration needed. Works with any git repository.

## üéØ Why You Need This

### Before: üòµ Context Chaos
- ‚ùå Switching branches loses your Claude context
- ‚ùå Manually copying CLAUDE.md files between branches  
- ‚ùå Forgetting what you were working on when you return
- ‚ùå Context pollution between different features
- ‚ùå Time wasted reconstructing context

### After: üéâ Seamless Context Flow
- ‚úÖ Claude always has the right context for your current branch
- ‚úÖ Zero manual file management required
- ‚úÖ Instant context restoration when returning to branches
- ‚úÖ Clean, isolated context per feature/bugfix
- ‚úÖ More time coding, less time context switching

## ‚ú® Features

### üîÑ **Automatic Context Switching**
Memory switches instantly when you change branches. No manual intervention required.

```bash
git checkout feature/user-auth    # Memory switches to auth context
git checkout hotfix/security-bug  # Memory switches to security context  
git checkout main                 # Memory switches back to main context
```

### üíæ **Intelligent Preservation**
Your work is automatically preserved with rich metadata.

```bash
# Before switching branches, your current work is auto-saved with:
# - Timestamp and description
# - Git repository context
# - Current branch information
# - Staged files and commit context
```

### ‚öôÔ∏è **Zero Configuration**
Works perfectly out of the box with sensible defaults, but fully customizable for power users.

```yaml
# Optional customization
memory_dir: ".claude/memories"
auto_save_on_checkout: true
create_new_branch_memory: true
fallback_to_main: true
```

### üõ°Ô∏è **Enterprise Ready**
Built for reliability and scale with professional error handling.

- **Safe operations** with automatic backup and rollback
- **Comprehensive logging** with rotation and multiple levels
- **Health monitoring** with diagnostics and system validation
- **Cross-platform** compatibility (macOS, Linux, WSL)
- **Security hardened** with input validation and secure operations

### Debugging Session Documentation
```bash
branch-memory save "Database performance investigation - RESOLVED

## Problem
Dashboard loading increased from 200ms to 3.5s after user activity feature

## Root Cause Analysis
- Profiled with Chrome DevTools: identified database bottleneck
- Found N+1 query problem: 847 queries for 20 activity items
- Missing index on activity_logs(user_id, created_at)

## Solution Implemented  
- Added composite index for optimal query performance
- Refactored ActivityService.getRecentActivity() to use JOIN
- Added Redis caching layer with 5min TTL

## Results
- Load time: 3.5s ‚Üí 180ms (95% improvement)
- Query count: 847 ‚Üí 3 queries  
- CPU usage: reduced 60%

## Files Modified
- migrations/008_activity_performance.sql
- src/services/ActivityService.ts (lines 45-89)
- src/controllers/DashboardController.ts (caching)

## Testing
- Load tested with 1000 concurrent users
- Verified no performance regression on other endpoints
- Memory usage stable under high load

auto_save_on_commit: true          # Add commit context to memory
create_new_branch_memory: true     # Create memory for new branches
fallback_to_main: true             # Use main memory as fallback
max_backup_files: 5                # Keep 5 backup files per branch
debug_enabled: false               # Enable verbose logging
```

### Team Knowledge Sharing
```bash
# Document complex solutions for team
branch-memory save "Performance optimization research - Database indexing strategy

## Problem Solved
Dashboard queries taking 3+ seconds under load

## Solution Strategy
1. Analyzed slow query log - found N+1 problem
2. Added composite indexes: (user_id, created_at, status)
3. Implemented query result caching with Redis
4. Refactored ORM queries to use batch loading

## Performance Impact
- Query time: 3.2s ‚Üí 140ms (96% improvement)
- Database load: reduced by 80%
- User satisfaction: load time now imperceptible

## Implementation Details
- Migration: migrations/008_performance_indexes.sql
- Caching: src/services/CacheService.ts
- Query optimization: src/repositories/ActivityRepository.ts

## Team Knowledge
This pattern can be applied to other slow dashboard components.
See performance-optimization.md for full methodology.
